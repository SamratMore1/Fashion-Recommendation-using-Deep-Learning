# Fashion-Recommendation-using-Deep-Learning

For this project first of all imported a Resnet model. 
Then performed the features extraction. 
After the features were extracted performed Transfer Learning to train the model on my dataset. 
For selecting the relevant images used KNN. 
Also with the help of Streamlit designed the frontend.
